# Task ID: 5
# Title: Build ICP Generator
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the ICP generator to create and edit customer personas.
# Details:
Implement a feature using GPT-4o to generate ICP details such as name, title, bio, goals, pain points, and buying behavior. Allow users to edit generated personas and save them to their workspace.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Integrate GPT-4o for Persona Generation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement GPT-4o to generate detailed customer personas, including demographics, psychographics, pain points, goals, and buying behavior.
### Details:
Utilize GPT-4o's advanced language processing capabilities to create comprehensive customer personas that accurately reflect target audience characteristics. Ensure the model is fine-tuned to produce realistic and relevant persona details for various business contexts.
<info added on 2025-06-13T23:46:19.761Z>
The integration of GPT-4o for ICP generation has been successfully completed. This includes the creation of a Supabase Edge Function `generate-icp` with GPT-4o integration, a structured prompt system for generating detailed customer personas, and a comprehensive ICP data model. The database schema has been established with an `icps` table, proper indexing, and RLS policies. Error handling, logging, and validation have been implemented, and the function has been tested with real API calls, confirming its ability to generate detailed ICPs and save them to the database. The API response structure includes success status, generated ICP data, database ID, and OpenAI usage statistics, with comprehensive error handling and CORS support for frontend integration. The next step is to proceed with the frontend ICP management interface and workspace functionality.
