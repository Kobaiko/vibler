# Task ID: 4
# Title: Develop Prompt-to-Funnel Engine
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the core engine that generates marketing funnels from user prompts.
# Details:
Use GPT-4o to process user prompts and generate marketing funnel components such as ICP, strategy, creatives, funnel flow, and KPIs. Implement a backend service using Supabase Edge Functions to handle prompt processing and data storage.

# Test Strategy:
Validate the engine by inputting various prompts and verifying the generated outputs for accuracy and relevance.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Integrate GPT-4o API for Prompt Processing [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the GPT-4o API to process user prompts and generate marketing funnel components such as ICP, strategy, creatives, funnel flow, and KPIs.
### Details:
Utilize GPT-4o's capabilities to interpret user inputs and produce structured data for marketing funnels. Ensure proper API authentication and handle potential errors gracefully.

**Implementation Plan:**
1. **OpenAI Client Setup**: Configure OpenAI SDK with API key from environment
2. **Prompt Engineering**: Design comprehensive system prompts for funnel generation
3. **Structured Output**: Implement structured JSON schemas for consistent AI responses
4. **Type Safety**: Create TypeScript interfaces for all generated components
5. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for API failures and rate limits
6. **Response Validation**: Validate AI responses against expected schemas

**Core Components to Generate:**
- **ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)**: Demographics, psychographics, pain points, motivations
- **Marketing Strategy**: Channels, budget allocation, timeline, objectives  
- **Creative Assets**: Ad copy, email sequences, landing page content
- **Funnel Flow**: Step-by-step customer journey with touchpoints
- **KPIs & Metrics**: Success metrics, conversion targets, tracking setup

Starting with OpenAI client configuration and basic prompt structure...

**COMPLETED: GPT-4o API Integration**

**What was implemented:**
1. **OpenAI Client Setup**: Complete OpenAI SDK integration with proper configuration
   - Modular client with configurable parameters (temperature, max tokens, etc.)
   - Structured output support for consistent JSON responses
   - Comprehensive error handling for API failures and rate limits

2. **Type System**: Comprehensive TypeScript types for all funnel components
   - `FunnelGenerationRequest`, `CompleteFunnel`, `IdealCustomerProfile`
   - `MarketingStrategy`, `CreativeAssets`, `FunnelFlow`, `KPIMetrics`
   - Response interfaces for all API endpoints

3. **Schema Validation**: Zod schemas for data validation
   - Input validation for all API requests
   - Output validation for AI-generated content
   - Type-safe parsing with detailed error messages

4. **Prompt Engineering System**: Expert-level system prompts
   - System prompt with 20+ years marketing expertise persona
   - Specialized prompts for each funnel component (ICP, Strategy, Creatives, Flow, KPIs)
   - Context-aware prompts that build on previous components
   - Comprehensive instructions for structured, actionable outputs

5. **Funnel Engine Core**: Main orchestration class
   - `FunnelEngine` class with complete funnel generation
   - Individual component generation methods
   - Health checks and API key validation
   - Error handling and response validation

6. **API Routes**: RESTful endpoints for funnel generation
   - `/api/funnel/generate` - Complete funnel generation
   - `/api/funnel/icp` - Individual ICP generation
   - Health check endpoints with API key validation
   - Proper error handling and status codes

7. **Test Interface**: Frontend test page for validation
   - Form interface for testing different prompt variations
   - Support for both complete funnel and individual component generation
   - Real-time API status checking
   - JSON result display with processing time metrics

**Key Features Implemented:**
- ✅ GPT-4o model integration with optimal parameters
- ✅ Structured JSON output with schema validation
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and logging
- ✅ Type-safe implementation throughout
- ✅ Modular architecture for maintainability
- ✅ Test interface for validation

**Ready for Testing:** 
The integration is complete and ready for testing. Note: OpenAI API key needs to be configured in environment variables for actual generation to work.
