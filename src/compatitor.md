I couldn’t locate the exact YouTube video you shared (ID: bykxR_wDl1o) to generate a video highlight UI, but I can absolutely craft a detailed step-by-step guide for how AdCreative.ai typically works—pulled from multiple reputable sources and screenshots—to help you understand its functionality.

Step-by-Step Guide: How AdCreative.ai Works

1. Onboarding & Brand Setup
	•	Create a brand profile: Upload your logo, select brand colors, add a short description about your business—this helps the AI align creatives with your branding  ￼.

2. Connect Integrations
	•	Link ad accounts and analytics: You can connect Google Ads, Facebook Ads, and Google Analytics. This enables the AI to learn from your historical performance data for smarter campaigns  ￼.

3. Create a Project
	•	Define a new creative project: Give it a name and choose the ad size—common presets: Square (1080×1080) or Story (1080×1920)  ￼.

4. Enter Copy & Upload Assets
	•	Write your headline, sub-headline, body copy, and CTA.
	•	Upload any visuals: Your own product image or select from a free stock library (millions of images available)  ￼.

5. Generate Creatives
	•	Click Generate and let the AI produce dozens (or even hundreds) of ad variations in seconds  ￼.

6. Inspect & Edit Variations
	•	Preview all the AI-generated options. You can tweak colors, fonts, imagery, and refresh the outputs as needed.

7. Evaluate with Creative Scoring
	•	The platform provides a conversion score for each creative. It analyzes factors like design, text placement, and CTAs—indicating which ads are more likely to perform well  ￼.

8. Use ‘Instant Ads’ or Custom Templates
	•	Try Instant Ads for one-click multi-format generation.
	•	Or build and save custom templates to easily replicate your unique style at scale  ￼.

9. Analyze & Optimize
	•	The AI analyzes your live ad performance. It provides insights on which creatives are winning—across platforms and competitors.
	•	Use Competitor Insights Pro to see your rivals’ ads  ￼.

10. Download or Publish
	•	Download image files (typically PNG) or push ads directly to Facebook/Google as integrated  ￼.

⸻

🧠 How It Works Under the Hood
	•	Data-Powered AI
Trained on millions of high-performing ads, the platform evaluates patterns in CTA placement, color schemes, typography, etc., to generate optimized creatives  ￼ ￼.
	•	Continuous Learning Loop
By feeding your ads back into the system via integrations, it refines future output—improving conversion predictability over time  ￼ ￼.
